<h1>The story</h1>
<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
    That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <blockquote class="villagers"> We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</blockquote> <p>The farmer said,<blockquote class="farmer">Maybe.</blockquote>
    <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,
    <blockquote class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</blockquote> <p>The farmer again said,<blockquote class="farmer">Maybe.</blockquote>
    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
    The neighbors then said, <blockquote class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too bad,</blockquote> <p>and the farmer responded, <blockquote class="farmer">Maybe.</blockquote>
    <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
    Again all the neighbors came around and said, <blockquote class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</blockquote> <p>Again, he said, <blockquote class="farmer">Maybe.</blockquote>
    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,
    and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune;
or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune. </p>

<h3>Conclusion </h3>
<p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
